# Project-OSINT

A flask web app made to perform OpenSource Intelligence. 

## Usage
- Clone the repo.
- Install requirements with "pip3 install -r requirements.txt".
- Run the "db.py" script to create a new sqlite3 database and an empty json file for storing API keys and login creds.
- Finally run the "app.py" file. Open the link in browser and login using default creds "test:test" (you can change them in the keys.json file)
